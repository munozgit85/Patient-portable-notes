## Description

Patient portable notes provide the healthcare provider a simple to use,
time-conservative option to charting on-the-go. Healthcare charting is a
required part of patient care. Adequate charting is, also, essential to
financial reimbursement. This application best suits the healthcare provider
who is assessing patients that are in the acute care setting such as emergency
rooms, hospital floors, and acute rehab units. Providers in this setting are ,
probably, multitasking between assessing patients, placing orders, communicating
with staff, and attending to emergencies. As a result, it is essential that the
provider has the patient data on hand when traveling throughout to various patient units.
The concern is finding time after attending to emergencies and seeing patients to dedicate
to charting adequately. Having a charting tool while walking to the next patient or even in
the room with the patient can conserve time and efforts later for the provider to dedicate to charting.
The essential parts of a healthcare progress note for an acute care patient is already pre-populated and
allows the provider to click on the pertinent details. In addition to this the Provider has the active vital
signs with remote monitoring that is connected to the patient's chart through the medical record number, name,
and date of birth. Having the remote telemetry and vital signs monitor interfaced to the app, the provider, then
, does not have to travel to each of the patients room, to see the telemetry monitor for the patient's current vital signs.

WHEN the page loads, THEN the user is presented with a form to input the patients name,
DOB, and Medical record number. The User is unable to input the details without sign up or Login.
WHEN the user signsup or login, THEN the user is able to input a patient's details to create
an encounter for a patient. WHEN the encounter is created, THEN the date and time stamp is created.
WHEN the user clicks on MyPatients tab, THEN the user is able to view the patients created for
that particular user with their telemetry and vital sign monitoring.
WHEN the user clicks on a particular patient, THEN the patients profile is viewed.
WHEN the user selects from a drop down tab of Review of Systems, THEN the user is able to
click submit to add the pertinent positive review of systems to a list.
WHEN the user selects from each physical exam class that is pertinent to the patient, THEN
the user is able to submit and add this physical exam to the list .
WHEN the user inputs a text for Assessment and plan, THEN the user is able to add
a full description for assessment and plan to the patients list.
WHEN the user selects from a drop down the patient's Disposition, THEN the provider is
able to add the disposition to the list.
